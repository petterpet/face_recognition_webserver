# Based on: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/web_service_example.py

# This is a _very simple_ example of a web service that recognizes faces in uploaded images.
# Upload an image file and it will check if the image contains a known face.
# Pictures of known faces must be stored in the specific folder.
# The filename should be the name of the person.

# The result is returned as json. For example:
# {
#  "status": "'OK' or 'ERROR'",
#  "number_of_known_faces": "number",
#  "face_found_in_image": "boolean",
#  "known_face_found_in_image": "boolean",
#  "persons_name": "string"
# }

# This example is based on the Flask file upload example: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fileuploads/
